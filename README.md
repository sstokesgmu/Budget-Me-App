# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


this project is an open source buttoning up tool that allows users the levers of freedom of an app like excel with the UI flashings of a app like Rocket Money 

## Frontend

this app is compose a three pages that allow users to see transaction history, account balances, and a foreign submission page to change an update information 

There's a little more information about the form:

- you cannot delete anything yet
- you can create a new account or a new transaction
- and the only thing you can update is the current balance of that account
